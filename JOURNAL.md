## Development Logs

### Decided the initial layout and added some components onto the Schematic. - August 17, 2025 <a id="decided-the-initial-layout-and-added-some-components-onto-the-schematic.-2025-08-17"></a>

**Time Spent:** 1m  

#### What I Did

I researched about different components and their required pins and decided to use Raspberry Pi instead of commonly used XIAO RP2040 due to the limitations of pins. 

#### Next Steps

Add more components and join schematics.

### Modified the schematic and placed components on PCB. - August 18, 2025 <a id="modified-the-schematic-and-placed-components-on-pcb.-2025-08-18"></a>

**Time Spent:** 1h 0m  

#### What I Did

I modified the schematic from 3x4 to 4x3 because of the weird looks with the screen. And placed components in the PCB.

#### Issues Faced

Only a little problem deciding the design.

#### Next Steps

Complete PCB routing.

### Completed the PCB. - August 18, 2025 <a id="completed-the-pcb.-2025-08-18"></a>

**Time Spent:** 1h 15m  

#### What I Did

Made some more changes to schematic and completed the PCB routing.

#### Issues Faced

Raspberry Pi footprint didn't had a 3d model, so had to add it manually.

#### Next Steps

Case

### Modified Schematic, PCB and Pi Pico Footprint. - August 24, 2025 <a id="modified-schematic,-pcb-and-pi-pico-footprint.-2025-08-24"></a>

**Time Spent:** 3h 0m  

#### What I Did

Created a custom footprint for the Pi Pico with through hole pads, modified the schematic to have add the rotary encoders into the switches matrix for ease in firmware and modified the PCB according to the new changes.

#### Issues Faced

The Raspberry Pi footprint doesn't have holes which could be good for SMD soldering, but I needed with headers, so not good for me.

#### Next Steps

Make the Case probably.

### Created top plate of the case. - August 26, 2025 <a id="created-top-plate-of-the-case.-2025-08-26"></a>

**Time Spent:** 2h 0m  

#### What I Did

Created the plate for the main case.

#### Issues Faced

Display orientation. I couldn't decide how to keep up the orientation so that it looks good.

#### Next Steps

Make the body.

**Time Spent:** 1h 30m  

#### What I Did

Added an outer cover for the display and added supports for touch sensors. Basically completed the whole case.

#### Issues Faced

None.

#### Next Steps

Polish the case.
